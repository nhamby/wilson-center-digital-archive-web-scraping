F.N.33.
New Delhi, 1st April, 1949.
My dear premier,
My last letter to you was sent on the 9th March, later than usual. I have skipped a fortnight and have now come back to the beginning of the month.
2. While we are naturally concerned with our domestic problems, developments in the international field are becoming more and more important for us. The whole situation in Eastern and South Eastern Asia is in a state of flux.
3. The issue of India and the Commonwealth has also to be faced squarely in the near future and, as you must know, I am going to London to attend the Dominion Prime Ministers' Conference which begins on the 21st April. The position in Burma has deteriorated and there appears to be no clear way of dealing with it or of our giving any help to ensure stability. The Indonesian question drags on its weary course in the Security Council and elsewhere. So does the Kashmir issue before the United Nations Commission.
4. From a world point of view, probably the most important event is the success of the Communist armies in China. Undoubtedly this is affecting, and will affect more and more in the future, not only the entire position in Asia but in the world. For us in India it is of the utmost importance.
5. It is clear that there is no force left in China which can effectively check the advance of the Communist armies. Those armies are sitting now on the banks of the Yangtze and can advance just whom they like. The Nationalist Government has been in a process of disintegration and are really in no position to insist on anything. Terms of peace therefore are practically terms of surrender. At the most some minor points here and there might be safeguarded. It is to the advantage of the Communists in China to get some legal settlement through a peace treaty. But whether this advantage is outweighed in their eyes by other factors or not is not clear.
6. In any event, what is likely to happen is a consolidation of the Communist regime in about two-thirds of Chinn and the advance of the Communist forces towards the South. Within a few months they should occupy the whole of China. It is possible that a splinter government might be formed in Canton, to oppose the Communists. But this is hardly likely to achieve anything. We may take it therefore that the whole of China will be under the control of the Chinese Communists within a few months.
7. The question then arises as to whether the revolutionary urge to advance will be satisfied and whether the new Communist dominated Government will be chiefly occupied in dealing with internal problems, or whether that urge will continue somewhat and affect the situation in Tibet, Indo-China and Siam. To some extent these neighbouring countries are bound to be affected. Tibet is a difficult country for any outside force to enter. But the internal economy of Tibet is very primitive. On the one hand they are religious heads, the Lamas who are also the feudal chiefs: on the other hand there are the people who are more or less serfs. Such a situation always has a certain explosive character unless economic changes take place. The success of Communism in China may apply as a spark to this explosive situation in Tibet. This may not take place suddenly or quickly, but the general tendency would be there.
8. In Sinkiang Province of China, Soviet influence is already considerable and the Soviets have obtained a privileged position by treaty with the Nationalist China. Sinkiang touches upon the Kashmir frontier and Afghanistan.
9. In Indo-China, the French Government has totally failed to defeat the Vietnam forces. VietNam represents a nationalist movement with fairly strong Communist leanings. The Chinese Communists will no doubt fully sympathise with it. The French, having failed during the past two or three years, are certainly not likely to make good now and the victory of Chinese Communism will make their position much worse. There can be little doubt that the French will have to withdraw from Indo-China and some kind of a Government will be established there which should be friendly to Communist China.
10. In Siam, there has been continuous manoeuvring at the top and palace revolutions. Behind this however there are deeper causes of unrest and the present Government can hardly be called stable. Events in China will no doubt encourage the anti-Government people in Siam, both nationalist and Communist, and it is quite possible that the Government may fall and give place to another which represents radical elements and Communists. It must be remembered that in Siam agrarian conditions are bad and the Government has largely represented big landlord elements. It is easy therefore for a movement against them to be built up.
11. In Burma, as I have said above, the situation is even worse than it was and there appears no hope of the return of security and stability. There is no obvious possibility of another Government which can control the situation effectively. At the Same time the present Government is hardly in a position to do so. Therefore conflict continues and  economic conditions go from bad to worse. Again, in Burma as elsewhere, the victory of the Chinese Communists and their approach to the Burmese border will make a difference
12. The policy of some of the Western Powers has been generally to support the more conservative governments in South-East Asia. This policy has failed. In Ghina even big scale support by the U.S.A, has not succeeded in making any difference. Indeed, psychologically speaking, it has been a definite disadvantage. People in China have felt that the Chinese Government was becoming a stooge of foreign powers and have turned away from it. It may be said that the victory of the Communists in China is due less to their inherent strength than to the disintegration of the Nationalist Government and its exceeding unpopularity with all classes of people. It could not learn the lesson in time and so it is passing into history.
13. To a much smaller extent, that policy is failing in other parts of South-East Asia. It is becoming impossible for conservative, landlord and like elements to control the situation in any country even with foreign help. Foreign help discredits them even more in the eyes of their people.
14. The result of all this would appear to be that Communist dominated governments are likely to be formed over a great part of Control, Eastern and South-East Asia, and that it is a very large part of the earth's surface. It is again a problem how far those Governments will be actuated by nationalist considerations, will their function like Yugoslavia, that is to say, will their policy generally, though Communist, be governed ty nationalist considerations also or will this policy be entirely subordinated to Soviet policy? In any event, probably in foreign affairs they will support the Soviet policy. They may not go the whole hog in case of war.
15. All this poses numerous problems to us in India. Directly we are not likely to be affected by those changes and there is no great fear of large scale infiltration across our frontiers or like trouble. I feel the apprehension about actual trouble on our frontiers is exaggerated, though of course we should be on our guard against it. The real difference will be two fold:
(i) continuous tension,
(ii) the raising of Communist morale in India.
That morale is relatively low at the present moment. The communists in India have, even from the Communist point of view, adopted a very wrong course. They have gone in for terrorist activities and sabotage and raised a volume of feeling against them in India. It is manifest that they cannot succeed by these methods in making much difference to the Indian scene, though they can create trouble. They have isolated themselves. Even at this terrorist policy some prominent Communists are said to have left the party or been purged. All this shows that the Communist leadership in India has overbalanced itself by its successive violence and wrong tactics and their morale at present is not high. Events in China and elsewhere however bolster up this morale to some extent and economic conditions help.
16. This leads us to a consideration of the general economic position in these countries of Asia. Undoubtedly the success of the communists has been due to primitive types of agrarian economy and the only way to deal with such a situation is to make rapid changes in this agrarian economy. These changes can be either towards peasant proprietorship or to some socialised system in land. Which of these courses is more suitable would depend on each individual country. If there is no peasant proprietorship and the masses of agriculturists are in the nature of serfs, then the change-over to socialist economy might be more rapid.
17. The Western Powers are gradually coming to realise that their policy in regard to Asian countries has not been a happy one. Their support of reactionary regimes has not helped those regimes to continue and has merely made those powers more unpopular in Asia. They are now thinking hard as to what they should do to change this policy. Probably it is too late for them to do anything very effective in this matter, before the changes they fear come about.
18. In Indonesia, the conflict of two policies is very evident. On the one hand the Western Powers are anxious to win the goodwill of nationalism in Indonesia, and that moans the Indonesian Republic, for the alternative means their losing such little influence as they possess in Asia. On the other hand, their European commitments induce them to build up a West European front, Atlantic Pact, etc., which include the Netherlands Government. It includes, in other words, certain colonial powers like the Netherlands and France, and it becomes the interest of the Western Group to build up the strength of these colonial powers. To some extent this can be done by the exploitation of colonial territories by those colonial powers. The Congo, for instance, is a preserve of Belgium, and is a very rich preserve, containing probably the largest deposits of Uranium minerals which are so necessary for atomic energy. Thus, from the point of view of consolidating their position in Western Europe, some powers have to go slowly in regard to the Netherlands and do not wish to weaken the Netherlands; from the point of view of their position in Asia, they wish to support the Indonesian Republic. There is this inherent conflict and hence their vacillating policy.
19. The fact is that in the larger world context, it is far more important, even from their point of view, to support nationalist and progressive elements in Asia and more particularly not to encourage any colonial exploitation in Asia. This will count for far more in the end than in smaller gains in Western Europe.
20. For India, all these developments and possibilities pose new questions or old questions in a new garb. We cannot associate ourselves in any way with a policy in favour of colonial exploitation. This, not only because it would be opposed to all that we have stood for, but also because in the present context it would be a most unwise and harmful policy, and is destined to fail. Hence our very special interest in Indonesia. Also we have to realise that economic reform is essential in order to meet the new situation. We in India, or some of us, are apt to think in rather static terms, not realising that big changes are afoot and that we shall be affected by them. Most of our people are mostly concerned with the next elections which may take place about the end of 1950 or perhaps early in 1951. No doubt these elections may well take place, but much will happen before they take place. It is better for us to think of all this that is happening now and will happen in the course of the next year or two, than to lose ourselves in thoughts of the election. Ultimately India’s strength and stability will depend upon her economic position and to the extent that we improve the standard of the masses. That is the vital issue before us.
21. There is undoubtedly a great deal of activity going on all over India, both in the Centre and in the Provinces, to develop our resources and innumerable schemes are in various stages of development. I have no doubt that our progress is going to be fairly rapid in the future. Nevertheless I have a feeling that there is a certain lack of coordination in these various efforts and what is necessary is more planning. I hope that in the months to come we shall give intensive thought to this business of planning.
22. The question of India’ s place in the Commonwealth, which is coming up for discussion soon in London, must be viewed in this larger context of Asian and world developments. I think that the policy we adopted six months or more ago was a right policy and we should hold on to it. This policy was to retain our complete independence as a Republic in regard to internal and external affairs, and at the same time to associate ourselves with the Commonwealth for purposes of consultation and cooperation. There is a desire on all sides for some way out to be found for this to take place. But certain difficulties have arisen. It may be that we shall get over them or the matter may be left undecided for- some more time. There are undoubtedly considerable advantages for us to remain in the Commonwealth, while maintaining our complete independence. But there are disadvantages for us to become tied up or committed to any policies which may come in our way, in the future and which may be opposed to our general approach. We want to be friendly and cooperative with the nations of the West but not at the cost of hostility to others. We feel that such a position will enable us ,not only to serve our own interests but those of Asia and of world peace much more effectively. If India can even to an email extent in averting a world war, she will have done a great service to the world.
23. Generally speaking, our relations with Pakistan are better. But incidents continue to happen which come in the way of real understanding. The East Bengal Government has started a vendetta against the Gandhi Ashram in Noakhali and arrested some of the workers left there by Gandhi ji. They have mado wild charges against them, which we cannot bring ourselves to believe. We cannot say much about Pakistani nationals but we have a right to speak up for Indian nationals who have been working there. We have asked for a full enquiry into the allegations made.
24. In the Frontier Province conditions appear to worsen.You may have seen the statement I made regarding the Frontier Province Communique about the Red Shirts and India helping them. It was after considerable thought that I made that statement, as I was afraid that my saying anything about the Red Shirts might lead to further suffering for them and more misunderstanding all round. But, having kept myself in check for over a year, I felt the time had come when I should say something. We have had no dealings with the Red shirts since the Partition, but we have undoubtedly felt deeply for them and for their brave leaders who were our comrades-in-arms for so many years in the struggle for India’s freedom.
25. The relations of Pakistan with Afghanistan have deteriorated very greatly. The chief dispute between them is in regard to the tribal areas. A statement on behalf of Pakistan that the Tribal Areas were integral parts of Pakistan has led to vigorous protests from Afghanistan. There has apparently been bombing of these areas by the Pakistan Air Force. Our relations with Afghanistan are good.
26. We have summoned some of our Ambassadors abroad to confer with us. Sardar Panikkar, our Ambassador in Nanking, is here. Our High Commissioner in London has also just arrived and our Ambassador in Moscow, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, is due here soon. From here she will go to her new post in Washington. Shri Dhirajlal Dosai, Our Minister at Berne in Switzerland, has also paid a visit to us to discuss various matters. There has been a great deal of speculation about these visits as well as about other matters. There is really nothing to speculate about and it is not India’ s way to carry on secret diplomacy. We cannot shout out everything from the housetops, but no essential stop is taken or can be taken behind the backs of the people. It is of great help to confer with our Ambassadors to understand a vast changing situation. A nation’s foreign policy is based on certain principles and objectives, but is at the same time very largely influenced by day-to-day happenings. Otherwise it becomes purely academic and unreal.
27. You will have noticed that our Industry and Supply Ministry has introduced legislation in the central control of certain industries. We feel that this is necessary from the point of view planning and coordination and the proper use of our resources. I propose to make a statement in Parliament soon on the subject of participation of foreign capital in India. Even before knowing what this is, some newspapers have started shouting against it. It amazes me how irresponsibly some of our newspapers have started shouting against it. It amazes me how irresponsible some of our newspapers function. This statement on foreign capital will be in line with the policy we have frequently declared. We wish to encourage foreign capital in India, subject always to the vital consideration of our not creating any vested interests here which might come in our way, and subject always to the primary consideration of advancing India's interests.
28. It has also been decided to appoint a Fiscal Commission.
29. I have a feeling, and I think it is justified by various events, that the industrial situation in India is on the mend and that the psychology of the country in this matter is definitely favourable now. I think we shall go ahead fairly fast, provided we do not fritter our energies over minor matters and petty conflicts. We are playing for high stakes in this country and the world and we dare not do so in a small and petty way.
30. The food situation requires constant care and I am glad to notice a fixed determination all round to make India self-sufficient in regard to food in the course of the next two years. Indeed we have no choice about this for if we do not do so and war or other calamities supervene, then we face disaster. Again I would remind you that we must concentrate
(i) on procurement,
(ii) on intensive cultivation so as to increase the yield per acre, and
(iii) schemes which yield rapid results.
31. I feel that, in some provinces at least, enough has not been done in regard to procurement and local conditions are considered more important than all-India ones. I trust that every province will realise that in this matter it is only all-India considerations that must prevail and that there must be uniformity in procedure and practice all over India. I would like to congratulate Bombay Province on their procurement.
32. We have invited Lord Boyd Orr, who used to be the Chairman of the F.A.0. to visit India soon to advise us about our food problems. He is a great expert and enthusiastic about helping India in this matter. We may also get some other experts from abroad. But essentially the responsibility is ours and what is necessary is for us to throw all our energy into this business. This means not only governmental energy but Congress energy. We can change the whole atmosphere of the country if we could concentrate on these constructive activities.
33. In regard to relief and rehabilitation, and more especially the letter, it seems to me that we should think in terms of setting up some autonomous boards in each province to deal with problems of rehabilitation. These boards should be small and should consist of experts. The work should be taken out of the day-to-day activities of Government and dealt with as a non-political activity on an expert level. Such boards could be given larger financial powers so that they can exercise their initiative. Of course they would be under the supervision and control of the Governments to whom they will report from time to time. Provinces must remember that the Centre’s resources are limited and it is quite impossible for us, even with the best will in the world, to supply unlimited funds.
34. I would like to draw your attention to one more point. There has been a tendency, even among Congressmen and our friends, to talk a great deal about the corruption and incompetence of Governments. Well, I have little doubt that there is corruption, and there is incompetence and there is wastage. We are trying hard to combat all these and I think we are succeeding, though slowly. It seems to me however that this business of condemnation is very much overdone. I think we can compare favourably with most countries. Continuous condemnation actually with most countries. Continuous condemnation actually leads to a feeling of lethargy and produces the very atmosphere in which corruption etc., flourish. There is a tendency to repeat every rumour without any attempt to verify it and so all kinds of vague and unjustified allegations float about from person to person. No responsible individual should allow himself to be a party to this kind of thing which is highly injurious to the nation. Let us by all means fight every evil, but let us also recognise that all is not evil and there is plenty of good and that in fact we are progressing pretty well. I do believe this and have reasons for doing so. Condemnation of our services is also not only unjustified but unwise. We should take action against malefactors but not condemn whole groups. We have inherited this from the past, but in the present context it has little place and only demoralises the services, from whom we expect good work.
Yours sincerely, (Sd).

 Main Points of Meeting Between Prime Minister Sato and National Defense Minister Chiang Ching-kuo
 November 24, 1967
Economic Cooperation Division
1. In the Event of a Request for a New Yen Loan:
We have heard that only a fifth of the existing yen loan of $150 million has been consumed. First, we would like to direct our efforts to promoting the use of this yen loan.
2. Regarding the Integrated Steel Mill Project:
(A) In the event of a request for private investment
Essentially, this is thought to be an issue for the private sector, so the first thing to do is to have a full discussion among those in the industry. As for the Government of Japan, if there is after that a request for investment, we would like to give it thorough consideration.
(B) In the event of a request for a switch to Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) financing
We have heard that, other than for the two projects, the Tsengwen Reservoir and the Kaohsiung Second Port, both countries have agreed in writing that the projects will not be objects of OECF financing. It would be difficult to make this project an object of OECF financing.
(Furthermore, in regard to this project at present, we had heard that there has been a conflict between a project to use coke, which the Commission for International Economic Cooperation and Development (CIECD) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has supported, and a project to use natural gas, which the Veterans Affairs Council (VAC) of the Ministry of National Defense has supported and which is dependent on US funds, and a final decision is still not in sight. However, as the matter is strictly an internal affair of the other side, so even if National Defense Minister Chiang should ask which proposal we find economically feasible, we would like you to answer “It would be appropriate for the project most suited to the economy of the Republic of China to be adopted.”)

Present State of Japan-Republic of China Economic Cooperation and Issues
1. Regarding yen loans to the Republic of China:
(1) Date established: April 26, 1965
(2) Amount: $150 million over a period of five years
(3) Projects:
There are 18 projects in all, including bridge reconstruction, port and harbor development (Kaohsiung, Keelung), and power transmission and distribution projects; improvement or modernization projects for various production equipment in sugar production, machinery, fertilizer, and aluminum; projects for expansion and modernization of various fertilizer plants, integrated iron and steel plant, and shipbuilding equipment; and the Kaohsiung Second Port and Tsengwen Reservoir projects.
(4) Loan conditions
(A) OECF financing (Tsengwen Reservoir, Kaohsiung Second Port)
Interest rate: 3.5%; repayment period: 20 years, with a grace period of five years
(B) Export-Import Bank of Japan financing (above-mentioned projects, excluding the OECF financing)
Interest rate: 5.75%; repayment period: between 12 and 15 years, with a grace period of three years
(5) Present conditions
Following the exchange of notes on the yen loan provision of $150 million, established on April 26, 1965, we concluded respective agreements, on December 10, 1965, for the first annual implementation agreement and on December 23, 1966, for the second annual implementation agreement. Of the total $150 million, we appropriated $76 million for the two agreements.
Of this amount, $31 million has actually been disbursed as of the end of September this year.
2. Regarding Request for New Yen Loan:
(1) On the occasion of Prime Minister Sato’s recent visit to Taiwan, Premier Yen Chia-kan produced a memo concerning the establishment of public enterprises and the development of the machinery and metalworking industries in order to implement the 5th Four-Year [Economic Development] Plan. The memo expressed the desire to enter into negotiations on a Second Yen Loan corresponding to the First Yen Loan in such aspects as scope and conditions and also asked for our country’s cooperation. The Prime Minister responded in saying that he would examine the contents of the memo.
(2) Furthermore, the Chinese side habitually makes judgments on the basis of the commitment base  (annual implementation agreement’s appropriated amount) regarding the state of progress on the current yen loan. However, as already stated, the disbursement base is $31 million.
3. Regarding Integrated Steel Mill:
(1) In regard to this project, there has recently been a conflict within Taiwan’s government between two proposals. One is for a project that would use natural gas, which the military’s VAC supports, and a project to use coke, which the MOEA’s CIECD supports. At present, the issue is under review in the Executive Yuan’s Steelworks Construction Promotion Commission. Contacts of the Embassy of Japan in Taipei have said that, because the first project has the backing of National Defense Minister Chiang Ching-kuo, there is the possibility of this becoming a major political issue in Taiwan.
(A) What our side has heard about the details of this project so far is that in the second project there would construction of an integrated mill, including cold rolling and hot rolling equipment, in an area adjacent to Kaohsiung Port, with an expected total construction cost of approximately $95 million, with the start of construction in 1968 and its completion by 1974. Of this, they are saying that they would like to use approximately $36 million of the above-mentioned yen loan of $150 million.
(B) The first project is a construction project that would use natural gas, with an expected total construction cost of $123 million, of which the North American Development Corporation is said to have already promised $97 million. The greatest merits of this project are said to be that, by using natural gas, there would be no need to use coke, thus potentially saving $30 million in foreign currency, and that the project would give many employment opportunities to military veterans and their families. In contrast, CIECD personnel have raised with our side’s officials such economic reasons as the thinking that, the available amount of natural gas in Taiwan being not that great, it should rather be used for fertilizer production. They have said that there is a great possibility of the second proposal being adopted, but that there are also moves within Taiwan’s legislature and the press in support of the first proposal. 
(C)  In either case, which proposal will be adopted is entirely Taiwan’s domestic affair. Therefore, in the process of selection, any words or actions of the Government of Japan suggesting support for either one runs the risk of involving us in Taiwan’s domestic affairs, so we need to refrain from any such thing.
(2) The Chinese side, for the sake of completing this project, has requested, other than technical cooperation, private investment of about $10 million from three Japanese steel companies  (Yawata, Fuji, and NKK) and, particularly in regard to this investment, strongly hopes for OECF financing of the three companies. This project was put forward by the other side in above-mentioned meeting of Prime Minister Sato and Premier Yen. In reply, the Prime Minister said that the first thing to do was to consult with industry and, once the discussions were complete, he would like to support it.
(3) There is a request from the Chinese side to switch the planned financing ($36 million) from the Export-Import Bank of Japan to the OECF. However, at the second annual negotiation in December last year,  at which time we approved the transfer of the Kaohsiung Second Port Project as the object of financing from the Export-Import Bank of Japan, the initial organization, to the OECF, the Chinese side presented a note verbale to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to confirm that, of the yen loan of $150 million, the OECF’s financing would not exceed $48.7 million for the Tsengwen Reservoir and Kaohsiung Second Port projects combined and that, even if it did not exceed the amount, the OECF would not finance other projects with the balance. The Chinese side’s above-mentioned request is therefore unacceptable.
4. Regarding Deferred Payment for Ships Limited to $30 Million
Concerning this issue, we have already presented a draft of the Japanese document confirming conditions and such to the ROC Embassy in Tokyo. On October 25, S.Y. Dao [Tao Shengyang], secretary-general of the CIECD, who was visiting Japan to attend the recent meeting of the Japan-China Cooperation Committee, visited Economic Cooperation Bureau Director Hirota Shigeru on October 25. Together with stating his appreciation for the Government of Japan’s special consideration, he said in regard to the document that our side had presented that it was under review with the Chinese government. He said that it seemed likely that there would be instructions from the home government to the Embassy of the Republic of China in Tokyo in the near future, but that for the most part they would likely be close to our side’s draft.",The Japanese Foreign Ministry provides an update on the state of Japan-Taiwan economic ties ahead of Chiang Ching-kuo's visit to Japan.,"[""Japan.

 The Chinese Communist Problem
 November 18, 1967
Asian Affairs Bureau
 1．The Cultural Revolution and the Chinese Communist Political Situation
The Mao-Lin faction, via the process of the Cultural Revolution that it has promoted over the course of the past two years, has overthrown so-called persons in authority (those who are relatively realistic in their thinking but whom Mao Zedong would view as revisionist and capitalist running dogs) in Party and government organizations, personnel and policies, and has continued the struggle to establish Mao Zedong absolutism in politics, the economy, culture, education, and elsewhere. The result is that by the beginning of this year the overthrow of persons in authority, on the surface, appears to have been more or less achieved. Of course, the way of thinking of Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and others remains. Moreover, whether in the center or in local areas, it appears that unity and solidarity have not necessarily been established within the Mao-Lin faction. Because of this, from spring this year into the summer, a large number of organizations calling themselves the Mao-Lin faction repeatedly confronted and fought one another, whether within Party and government organizations or within those of workers and peasants. Even the military, brought in to bring the situation under control, at times appears to have supported anti-Mao-Lin factions(there were probably times when it misjudged which was the orthodox Mao-Lin faction). Due to this, bloodshed took place in various places and, for a time, industrial production and the functioning of transport and communications were paralyzed.
The Mao-Lin faction, in order to bring the disorder under control and secure the autumn harvest, which accounts for 70 percent of agricultural production, switched tactics from around September this year. Putting in order the center’s system, calling on people to follow the Party Center and local governing organizations and the military, along with calling for a “grand coalition” in various areas, the faction seems to be trying to keep internal conflict to a minimum. In this way, the political situation of the Chinese Communists concerning the Cultural Revolution now seems to have left the stage of destruction and entered that of control. The system as a unified nation is being maintained somehow or other, but there are problems to some extent or other even with the Liberation Army, the foremost political weapon for the Mao-Lin faction. In addition, we think that the situation remains extremely fluid because the axes of authority for the Chinese Communists, both in the center and in local areas, are in disorder in their organization and staffing.
In this way, because the confusion in the Chinese Communist political situation will likely continue for the time being we think that the domestic and foreign policies of the Chinese Communists will basically continue to be rigid ones for now.
2．Chinese Communist Foreign Policy
The foreign posture of the Chinese Communists since the Cultural Revolution has been a particularly hard-line one, with the Chinese Communists starting with various countries disputes that seem unnecessary. The result is that various countries have become, so to speak, alienated from the Chinese Communists. Also, the countries around the Chinese Communists have grown increasingly wary. We think that this was definitely not a plus for the future of the Chinese Communists.
How long the Chinese Communists will continue such a posture is a difficult point. As noted above, however, if the Cultural Revolution in Communist China moves in the direction of settling down, then there is the possibility for a recovery of reason and a revival of realistic thinking even among the Chinese Communists leaders. Therefore, we are hoping for the emergence of flexibility in their foreign posture.
Naturally, there is no reason to expect that they will so easily change such postures as those regarding aid to North Vietnam in the war in Vietnam, regarding the Soviet Union or regarding the United States.
3. Our Country’s Policy on the Chinese Communists
(1) We think that, as the Chinese Communists are progressing steadily in their nuclear infrastructure, it may take time, but they are likely to become a country in possession of considerable nuclear weapons. We think, therefore, that the countries around China will feel more and more strongly the Chinese Communist threat.
However, should reason and realism return to Chinese Communist leaders, then even if they are Chinese Communists, they are likely to actively avoid making the first move to actually use nuclear weapons. Therefore, the threats are likely to be in such areas as infiltration by political or psychological means or by political intrigue. The most important elements to counter this are for the countries around China to become politically stable and economically developed, and for their people to become affluent. It is necessary for us, before it is too late, to cooperate to bring as quickly as possible stability and prosperity to the countries of Asia.
(2) Japan in regard to the Chinese Communists has adopted for the past 10 years or so a policy of separating politics from economics, that is to say, a policy of avoiding political issues as much as possible and associating with them in trade, economic, cultural, and other areas. With the Chinese Communist side always raising political issues (for example, the Taiwan issue, relations with the United States, and such), maintaining this policy is not easy, but we are sticking to it. We think that in thereby opening a window for the Chinese Communists is of major significance in that it brings the Chinese Communists into contact with the Free World. Also, with newspaper reporters from Japan residing in China and people coming and going, it will be useful for learning conditions inside China. This was particularly the case recently in the course of the Cultural Revolution. The attitude of the Chinese Communists towards Japan, as expected, grew harsh as the Cultural Revolution progressed, with increased criticism of the Government of Japan, the expulsion from China of our newspaper reporters, and the harassment of Japanese trading company employees. Trade volumes, too, either remained flat or showed declines. Recently, however, there was a notice from the Chinese Communist side on the start of negotiations over LT trade, showing their interest in trade with Japan. We think that this may be a sign of a change in the above-noted attitude of the Chinese Communists.
[Paragraph’s first line and first half of second line redacted] Even if the Chinese Communists have armed themselves with nuclear weapons, Japan will not do so. In regard to nuclear weapons, we have confidence in the Japan-United States Security Treaty. As for other threats from them, there is almost no worry over influence from the Chinese Communists on Japanese due to the rapidly rising standard of living of our people. We believe that there is a strong sense of nostalgia among Japanese in regard to China but that they will correctly appraise the Chinese Communists as they come into contact with China and increase their contacts. We think that even if our side exercises influence on them, there is increasingly little concern about being influenced from the other side.","Ahead of a visit by Chiang Ching-kuo to Japan, the Japanese Foreign Ministry reviews the political situation on Mainland China.","[""Japan.

 Petition on Opposition to the Coming to Japan of Taiwan’s National Defense Minister Chiang
 The historic undertaking of the improving of relations between Japan and China – a major issue of our country’s diplomacy, together with the broadly stalemated war in Vietnam – is becoming increasingly difficult.
In the midst of such a situation, our country’s 100 million people, who wish for the prosperity of the nation and the Japanese people, have been completely calm in their response to the present policy of improving relations between Japan and China and sincerely hope that this great undertaking will be accomplished without problems or difficulties.
Regrettably, however, the recent state of affairs between the two countries has, on the contrary, further intensified a worrisome situation. With his coming to Japan scheduled to take place soon, the invitation of Taiwan’s Minister of National Defense Chiang Ching-kuo is something conspicuous that will further pour fuel on this trend. In particular, it may prove a fatal obstacle to trade between Japan and China.
Taiwan, for China, is completely Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is at present thought to have become the firm conviction of all the people. I believe that here is rooted the main cause of the Yoshida Letter and other issues becoming decisive obstacles for friendship and trade between Japan and China, in particular to the expansion of LT trade.
Should such a situation build upon itself, China’s wariness regarding Japan will grow day by day. In the end, expectations that the 700 million Chinese people were all holding in regard to our country will turn into distrust. The concern that it would accumulate and turn in a direction of intense opposition to -Japan is fully conceivable.
In the past, on account of the suspension of trade in 1958, relations between Japan and China were entirely interrupted. As a result of our country’s backbreaking national efforts and China’s measures to improve relations with Japan, the mutual efforts of Japan and China built upon one another and trade gradually resumed. Today, it has expanded to a scale of 620 million dollars. However, even that trade is once again facing a difficult crisis.
I ask you that please consider in greater depth the present situation. In order for Japan and China, on the basis of mutual confidence, cooperating with one another, each making efforts, to open the way to enable an increase in friendship and the development of trade, at this time, more than anything else, I hope that steps are taken to cancel this invitation to National Defense Minister Chiang and that improvements in relations between Japan and China are expeditiously put into concrete form.
On the basis of the decision of the Japan-China Import-Export Association’s emergency board meeting, we make this petition.

 The Sato Government has disclosed that it is “inviting” Chiang Ching-kuo to Japan on November 27.
Chiang Ching-kuo is a leader of the Chiang Kai-shek Group that was driven out by the 700 million people of China, the “Minister of National Defense,” the ringleader who controls their military, military police, and special service units. We, who desire true friendship and cultural exchange between the people of Japan and China, cannot accept that such a person, who interferes in the internal affairs of China, should step on the soil of Japan.
Prime Minister Sato’s “visits” to South Korea, Taiwan, and South Vietnam supported the disgraceful war of aggression in Vietnam, viewed with hostility the 700 million people of China, and trampled upon the aspirations of the peace-loving Japanese people. In particular, that the authorities inflicted brutal repression against people who were demonstrating on October 8 against Prime Minister Sato’s departure from Haneda Airport, which went so far as to end in the taking of a life, speaks eloquently to the militarization and fascist character of the Sato government. Prime Minister Sato, furthermore, announced on November 12 his intention to “visit” America, ignoring the widespread anger of the Japanese people, but we absolutely cannot overlook the policy of the Sato government, which is turning its back on the Japanese people and looking away from the world’s progress, of looking with hostility at China and following American imperialism.
Voices that oppose the invasion of American imperialism and desire the liberation of the oppressed people are rising higher and higher. Chiang Ching-kuo’s “coming to Japan” – when even in America, the invading country, popular protest and struggle are blazing up, arranged with the intent to strengthen collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek faction that has drawn American imperialism into Taiwan, territory of the People’s Republic of China, and has become under its protection the running dogs of American imperialism – is a plot to destroy from the roots the friendship and exchange of the people of Japan and China that the people of Japan and China have diligently cultivated. We absolutely cannot accept it. Chiang Ching-kuo’s “coming to Japan” is a stupid action equivalent to the Sato government strangling itself.
In order to oppose Chiang Ching-kuo’s “coming to Japan” and stop it, we are determined, in appealing broadly to public opinion and collaborating with relevant persons from various spheres, to carry out a resolute struggle.

 Subject: The Chancellor's Meeting with British PM Blair on 20 October 1997, 10.30 a.m. - 3 p.m. in Chequers[1]
here: essential topics and results
 At the above-mentioned meeting, which took place in a very friendly and open-minded atmosphere. the following topics were mainly dealt with:
1. domestic political development in both countries
2. Further orientation of European policy (""Great Britain in Europe"")
3. European Economic and Monetary Union
4. European aerospace industry
5. Preparation of the special session of the European Council on Employment on 20./21. November 1997
6. European Agenda 2000 (enlargement, finance, agricultural policy)
7th conference on Nazi gold in London from 2-4. December 1997
8. EU tobacco advertising
9. BSE
10. Preparation of the G8 summit in Birmingham 15.-17. May 1998
From the conversation, especially with regard to the operational conclusions, I essentially state:
Discussion of the domestic political situation in both countries (especially the economy, employment issues, attitudes to immaterial values)
European Economic and Monetary Union
PM stated that government would give an statement on its position in the near future. He and his government were in principle in favor of monetary union. He assumed that Great Britain would not be in the first group in 1999. It was also unlikely that the decision would be made before the next general election in 2001/2002. He needed time to convince the public of the monetary union and European policy. It was very difficult to win a referendum; his government could not afford defeat. There were no constitutional obstacles. Of course, it was also important that the economic environment was right for the euro. It was vital that the euro would actually work.
Britain would lead its 1998 EU Presidency in a constructive manner, ensuring that decisions would be taken according to the timetable and criteria. It was desirable that the largest possible number of member states would join in .
BK affirmed that the monetary union had to come now. No objection to Great Britain would join in in 2001/2002. He would see to it that the Europeans would not put up any barriers to this. From his point of view, it was important not to maneuver GB into a corner.
 Great Britain’s Role in Europe
BK expresses understanding for the difficulties British politics faces in relation to Europe. As a result, his policy was consistent with the policy of the Prime Minister. He wanted his thesis ""Great Britain needs Europe, but Europe also needs Great Britain"" to become a reality.
PM explains in detail the historical background of the relationship between Great Britain and Europe. He wanted to make it clear that Britain's place was in Europe. The stronger the relationship with Germany, but also with France, the easier it would it be for Great Britain to be a real player in the EU. He expresses understanding for the differences in the German-French relationship compared to the German-British or French-British relationship based on history.
BK advocates setting positive practical examples in the German-British relationship (as in Europe in general). This applies, for example, to the aerospace industry, but also to partnerships, for young people, business and science. Affirmation that the next few years would be decisive for this. Europe had to find its identity now, also because of internal American development (tendency to look inward).
PM emphasizes that his problem was the public and the press. But he thinks he could make the transition. It was important for him that the Europeans helped him to show how we in Europe would actually create alliances among equals.
When asked, BK explains the Franco-German agreement on the ""Eurorat"" (informal nature; meeting in connection with meetings of the Ecofin Council), which should not cause problems for GB.
PM asks about agreement on German-French-Russian summits.
BK explains the history and background of this agreement with Yeltsin and Chirac. Indication of Italian irritations. He, Blair, would not have any problems with BK here.
European Aerospace Industry
As an example of close cooperation, BK ties in with the need to bring the European aerospace industry together. This presupposes prudence on both the British and German sides in order to get the French on board.
PM agrees. Restructuring of European industry is important, otherwise European industry would be eaten up by America. Trilateral action Germany - France - Great Britain is the key. BK also refers to the inclusion of Italy, Spain and Sweden.
Afterwards a short exchange of views on domestic political developments as well as on linking the military and civilian areas in the USA.
Preparation of the special European Council on Employment 20-21 November 1997
PM then addresses employment summits and emphasizes, referring to the preparatory work of the employees, that GB and D are by and large probably on the same line.
At the request of BK, I explained the state of opinion-forming, in particular with reference to the paper sent at short notice by the British, but pointed out that the adoption of quantitative guidelines proposed by the Commission and supported by PM Juncker caused us considerable problems.
PM pointed out that from a British point of view, qualitative guidelines were more important. The key was the right message from this special summit. From a British perspective,
the focus should be on questions of employability, the reorientation of social policy and support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Germany was also looking for impulses in the latter area.
BK agrees and especially refers to the need for start-ups; this aspect is a weakness in Europe.
PM agrees. Part of the economic reforms. which Margaret Thatcher initiated in the UK were correct. Employment summit had to send out clear signals in the direction of employability and small and medium-sized enterprises; bureaucratic hurdles should be removed in the latter area.
Agenda 2000 (Finance. Agriculture)
BK addresses Agenda 2000. With regard to agricultural policy as well as finances, German-British problems could be foreseen with certainty. This also applied in particular to agriculture, where the British and German positions had always been diametrically opposed.
PM replies that he understands very well that this is a very sensitive topic in D. EU needs further reforms in the agricultural sector. He assured BK, however, that he would deal with this issue very sensitively, especially during the EU presidency.
Tobacco Advertising
BK refers to the efforts of the LUX Presidency to enforce a general ban on tobacco advertising at the meeting of EU health ministers on December 4th in LUX. This would also affect Formula 1, with the consequence that the races would go away from Europe. From his point of view, the aim must therefore be to achieve at least exemptions here.
PM refers to a recent visit from Ecclestone and Mosley to him. Basically, it would be the right line in itself to leave possible measures here to the individual member states in application of the subsidiarity principle. In any case, he had no intention of losing Formula 1 from the UK and will speak to the Minister of Health.
Nazi Gold Conference in London
BK emphasizes that the federal government wanted to be helpful. If one was not careful, however, the conference would take a completely different direction.
PM points out that the conference would be led by Lord Mackay, Lord Chancellor of the previous Conservative government. He is a very clever, balanced man. He would formally ask the Foreign Minister to act in a careful, sensitive manner at the conference.
The conversation will then continue over lunch.
First a short exchange of views on the question of BK about the development of the press in the UK.
BSE
PM pointed out that GB had made a number of proposals which had already passed through the Scientific Committee and which were now to be discussed and decided in the Veterinary Committee. He very much understood the concerns of the German public with regard to BSE; GB had introduced the safest rules and controls today. He emphasizes that he would be grateful to BK if D - even if there were differences in the matter - did not ensure that there was a mood against GB and for a strong opposing position.
BK agrees to review the issue. He points to problems in the Federal Council as well as to German mood and the difficult situation of the farmers.
EU Enlargement
PM briefly explains the direction of the British position in relation to enlargement and Agenda 2000, focusing on the following:
GB supported the Commission's approach of starting negotiations with the five CEE countries and Cyprus; all other countries would have to stay in the process.
GB was in principle in favor of a European conference. One was aware of the problem of Turkey. But something had to be done for Turkey.
With regard to Agenda 2000, the UK believed that pervasive reforms of the common agricultural policy were necessary. It was important to decide the relevant benchmarks for future finances as early as December. Of course, GB wanted to stick to its premium reduction. But they understood the German problem and thought about how to help here.
With regard to Cyprus, BK stressed that he had serious concerns, even if one disregarded the basic unresolved issues. In this respect, he points to findings that Cyprus is increasingly becoming a central hub for the Russian mafia.
BK goes on to say that in matters of enlargement, it was crucial for us to manage it politically and psychologically to start negotiations now with a first group, but at the same time to encourage the other countries of Central Eastern Europe.
In response to questions from BK, PM explained his ideas with regard to the European conference proposed by the Commission and the
with regards to its key points and structures. In this way, a kind of forum could be created in order to underline to these countries that they were on their way to joining the European Union as candidate countries.
BK critically questions the structure of such a conference, also with regard to meetings on a political level, and confirms that he reserved the right to comment and that we still have to discuss it in detail.
With regard to the Turkey problem, he explains that D is in no way opposed to Turkey, on the contrary - Yilmaz is a good man. The decisive problem for D was freedom of movement. Without a solution to this problem, D could not agree to join at a later date.
PM agrees with BK's assessment and emphasizes that one had to try to find ways out. The question was whether an exception can be made.
BK repeats that one has to work out a solution that definitely eliminates the problem for D. Moreover, he had emphasized to Demirel and Yilmaz - and they had agreed with him - that accession would not be due for decades. Of course, one had to be careful not to damage the forces that oppose fundamentalism.
PM affirms that BK was right. GB stood in its sympathy on the German side.
Preparation G 8 - Birmingham
The BK and PM agree on the organization and structure of the summit on the basis of the PM's letter and the proposals of Sherpa Undersecretary Stark.

 M e m o r a n d u m - for internal use only
 Subject: The Chancellor's Conversation with Portuguese Prime Minister Guterres on 17 October 1997, 10 a.m. - 11.15 a.m.[1]
 Below is a summary of the conversation in which the Portuguese diplomatic advisor Joao Pimentel (who left in November) took part, and which took place in a decidedly friendly and trusting atmosphere:
The Prime Minister thanks for the positive assessment and confirms that his government is and will remain resolute in its approach in Europe. After the loss of the colonies, Europe was a key question of Portugal's identity. Portugal wanted to be fully in the heart of Europe. One had lost decades because one had lived with one’s back to Europe.
From a Portuguese point of view, this was about preserving European civilization and culture. Events like the Frankfurt Book Fair were of particular importance for Portugal. Portugal wanted to be seen as it is today. Yesterday he spoke to the College of Europe in Bruges, and he had been very optimistic about Europe's future; the young people responded very positively. Today more than ever it was important to bring the vision of a united Europe, the European project, to the outside world. He tried to make this clear to the Portuguese over and over again emphasizing that European unification was a collective vision, a collective project, not simply the sum of national interests.
The Chancellor agrees with the statements made by the Prime Minister; he wanted to use his remarks to make some fundamental remarks on the German-Portuguese relationship:
Geographically, Germany and Portugal were far from each other. In this century, there had never been any significant problems between the two countries. He congratulated the Prime Minister for actively bringing the Portuguese position and situation to the EU. The openness of Portugal to Latin America and Africa was particularly important for the EU.
For him, there is an additional argument that is very important. He was interested in seeing the smaller countries in the EU develop as well as possible. He was also interested that Germany had particularly good relations with the small countries. This had positive effects for Germany's position in Europe. In this sense, he wanted the closest possible German-Portuguese relations in all areas including politics, economy and culture.
The Prime Minister thanks the Federal Chancellor for his remarks. Germany helped Portugal most to consolidate democracy. He wanted to make personal appeals to the Federal Chancellor today: First of all, as a socialist, Christian and democrat, he wanted to appeal to the Federal Chancellor. He viewed the election in 1998 with mixed feelings, especially since the Federal Chancellor had always shown himself to be a factor of stability for Europe. It was therefore essential to achieve two things before September 1998, namely the Euro and the opening of accession negotiations; both things ought to be irreversible.
For Portugal, enlargement was first and foremost a political issue. Europe had a duty towards the Central and Eastern Europeans to start enlargement now, even if there would certainly be difficult negotiations afterwards. The enlargement negotiations should therefore start in early 1998 as planned.
He saw a real problem with the enlargement negotiations. He had just been to Romania, which is making an admirable change thanks to Constantinescu. In Romania, the Americans had created unnecessary problems for the Europeans through the decision at NATO. In his view, EU accession negotiations should not be held with all candidates at the same time. The only consequence would be a standstill and a delay in accession. A formula had to be found that the Romanians could use to save face.
Therefore, he proposed the following formula to President Santer: One should start negotiations with some countries that were already ripe in the sense of a fast track. One should also say that negotiations should be started with the other countries, but of a different kind with other stages.
In this way one could prevent the feeling of rejection. Indeed, the talks with some had to be pursued faster; others would initially reach a kind of pre-accession stage. From his point of view, this was politically important so that the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe did not lose their previous enthusiasm for Europe.
At the beginning, the Chancellor referred to the reasons for his renewed candidacy (Europe, internal reforms). With regard to enlargement, he agreed in principle with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister knew his commitment. It is correct, on the one hand, that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe had to meet the requirements themselves. We can only help people to help themselves.
The Prime Minister went on to say that his last appeal was on Agenda 2000. The discussion on this question was still going on in a calm manner at the moment. The decisions were not yet due, but only at the end of 1998/99. One understood very well the German concerns to reduce the burden as a net payer. However, one foresaw difficulties with regard to Agenda 2000. A study by the London School of Economics had already found that Portugal was the victim of enlargement. Indeed, if Agenda 2000 was adopted as it was designed, Portugal would lose out in all areas. Agricultural expenditure would increase slightly, but Portugal would not benefit from this.
With regard to the Cohesion Fund, Portugal was basically aiming to maintain the current level; but one fully understood German objections. With regard to the future of the Structural Funds, one question was most important for Portugal (different from Spain, which received mainly money from the Cohesion Fund). It was about the Lisbon region, which represented a third of the country and was at the same time the engine of the economy. If the Commission proposals were implemented, Lisbon would be dropped.
If these particular questions were to be ignored, Portugal would also suffer damage in relation to its financial obligations and returns, and one would almost risk becoming a net payer.
He had discussed this in detail with Juncker and Santer and asked both of them to study this problem very carefully, and he considered an objective analysis to be necessary. He understood that the structural funds should not grow any more from 1999 onwards. He also recognized that it would be necessary in later times to gradually reduce the funds for Portugal. Now, however, a sensible and just solution had to be found. He had to be able to defend this at home.
The Chancellor stressed that he understood the Prime Minister very well. There was no time pressure on this matter. He suggestion was that the staffers also ought to work very closely together in this regard. It was important for him that the Agenda 2000 was not psychologically linked to enlargement. All in all, what he said earlier to the Prime Minister about the German-Portuguese relationship also applies here.
The Chancellor went on to say that he wanted to address an entirely different topic pertaining to the EU advertising directive for tobacco products. He was against a total ban and he was against any extremes and wanted a sensible solution to this problem. It was important not to adopt the propositions of Luxemburg’s Presidency on during the deliberations of the health ministers on December 4th.
It would only have an adverse effect leading to a situation where we would not have any further  Formula 1 races in Europe, and also in Portugal. A sensible compromise had to be found here, as the Germans had suggested earlier. He asked the Prime Minister look into this matter. Their staffers ought to think about potential ways to influence the outcome.
The Prime Minister pointed out that he had not yet followed this matter closely. In his cabinet, there was only a real battle of words between the health and finance ministers on this matter. He would take care of this matter. By the way, Portugal attaches great importance to Formula 1, as the race in the Formula 1 calendar has just been stolen from the French.
He wanted to briefly address another European problem. He recently met with the Prime Minister of Turkey. Yilmaz had told him that Germany was not only in favor of Turkey joining later, but also of Turkey's participation in the European conference. There were some reservations in Portugal about this conference. His approach was to follow Germany’s line. Germany was the country that was mostly affected. He would give instructions accordingly.
The Federal Chancellor referred to Yilmaz as an old friend and a very good man. He was a stroke of luck for Turkey and Europe in the current situation. However, Yilmaz did not correctly reflect his view here.
On the basis of the press release of September 30th, he explains our basic position and confirms that the decisive factor for him is the solution to the issue of freedom of movement - but he did not see a solution yet. If this did succeed, the number of Turks in Germany would at least double within a short time. But Germany was not fundamentally against accession. This question would not arise today.
At the same time, however, one must be careful not to push the moderate European forces in Turkey into a corner. If Turkey was to be shoved out of the door, one would risk exactly the opposite in Turkish domestic politics. It should therefore be considered how, with a view to a European conference or a similar body, a special status could be found for Turkey which would do justice to these premises and which would make it clear that there would be no accession in the near future.
Moreover, the whole problem was complicated by the Cyprus question. He also referred to certain progress made with the Turkish side with regard to important bilateral issues, particularly citizenship. One’s staffers ought to keep in close contact and keeping each other abreast of developments in attitudes.
The Prime Minister thanked the Chancellor. The Portuguese Government was ready at any time to coordinate its position with us and to follow us, as we were really the most concerned.

 M e m o r a n d u m
 Subject: Chancellor's Conversation with the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, on the sidelines of the NATO Summit in Madrid on 8 July 1997[1]
 From a 30-minute conversation (which I joined five minutes after it started), I note:
Kuchma made it clear that internally he was under considerable pressure from reform-critical forces. Important reform laws would be blocked by parliament with a view to the parliamentary elections in spring 1998. This year, the ""left"" would try to gain political benefit from the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the October Revolution. Against this background, the development of relations between Ukraine and the West was particularly important. The signing of the NATO-Ukraine Charter on July 9 was said to be particularly important also of psychological importance.
Cooperation with the IMF is also one of the blocked processes. Ukraine fulfills all criteria (in particular budget deficit and inflation rate). Nevertheless, one does not get any further with cooperation (reference to visiting IMF delegation). Extensive restructuring would have to take place. These took time.
The Chancellor asked if our conversation with the IMF could be helpful. Kuchma answered yes, and The Chancellor pledged to do this. The Chancellor also asked for a list of the current problems in Ukraine where help from the German side seemed sensible. Kuchma should bring this with him for lunch on July 9, 1997, he would then personally take care of the problems immediately after his return to Bonn (in conversation with Undersecretary Stark). We are interested in the stability and success of Ukraine.
When asked by the Chancellor about possible problems in bilateral cooperation, Kuchma mentioned the projects discussed during the BK visit (energy, promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises). Acceleration is required here. Kuchma also mentioned problems with the Hermes salary classification. Finally, Kuchma mentioned the Chernobyl commitments. The Chancellor noted that the handling by the EBRD in London was unsatisfactory. He also expressed this in Denver at the G-7 summit.
Kuchma suggested setting up a German-Ukrainian commission similar to the one that exists between the Ukraine and the USA (Kuchma / VP Gore). Such a foundation would be of great psychological importance. The Chancellor showed sympathy for the thought; he understood what was meant by it. He wants to think about the proposal and bring about a decision soon.
The Chancellor summarized: He understood the warning signals and would endeavor to help - with regard to the international financial institutions, the bilateral projects, but also with a view to the proposed Commission. (Interjection by Kuchma.: We also have problems with the EU. The Chancellor: We could help there too). He, the Chancellor, is a ""Ukraine fan"". That's what he said to Yeltsin (Kuchma: ""Yeltsin told me that too""). Ukraine has many friends in Germany. The future development in Ukraine is important for Europe. He always advises looking to Moscow and Kiev. As the third largest country in Europe, Ukraine is a factor of stability on the continent.

Essential issues and results
1. Bilateral issues
BK thanks Pres. N for the invitation, he is thinking of visiting KAS on his way back from Beijing in the spring of 1998.
BK emphasizes that he is looking forward to the visit of President N in November in Germany. The aim of his short meeting today is to arrange good preparation for the visit in order to achieve the goal of a new quality in relations in all areas.
Preparation should take place both on the traditional track (AA, BMW, BMF, BMZ) and by personal employees (BK names signatories as contact persons for this).
Pres. N is ready to send small groups to Bonn in order to vote on the ""agenda"" in detail.
At the request of the Federal Chancellor, President N will send a strictly personal letter directly to the Federal Chancellor in the next 14 days, in which he explains his wishes and offers in detail.
President N confirmed the objective and will that KAS wanted to develop close cooperation with the EU, but above all in relation to D (Germany, if possible, in 1st place "").
He mentioned the following points where there are concrete options:
• Construction of an energy complex by Siemens
• Cooperation in the oil and gas sector
• Infrastructure issues, especially telecommunications
• Mechanical engineering
Further
• Establishment of a house of the German economy in Almaty based on the model in Shanghai processing industry (especially agricultural products)
• Promotion of the settlement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
• Settlement of industry especially (“50%”) in the regions where people of German origin live in order to induce them to stay in KAS.
• Cooperation also in other areas in the completion and further development of the relationships in all areas across the board (e.g. security policy)
• BK adds: cooperation in the fields of science, research
• (Note: Foreign Minister Tokayev spoke to me about a ""new contract"" to bring the entire range of cooperation under one roof; I was very reluctant to get involved)
Comments from President N. on individual areas and on economic development
Exploitation of riches in mineral resources of various kinds, especially oil and natural gas. KAS would like to increase production (now 26 million tons - target 2000: 50 million tons, 2010 100 million tons with own consumption of 20 million tons) and export to (Western) Europe;
Different ways imaginable
- either via RUS (RUS, however, sees competition in KAS and has so far refused transit); Please contact BK to influence RUS in this respect)
- or about Iran (problem: political situation)
- or via Afghanistan / Pakistan (problem: war in Afghanistan without end)
- or to / via China (on this first positive discussions)
To this end, they want to work with German companies. The pipeline to the Black Sea will pay for itself in 2-3 years after completion.
Also important for investors: political stability in the country, privileges for investors, convertible currency and profits, inflation in 1997 only 17% (in 1993 still 2500%). Currency stable against the dollar. Significance of KAS as a transit country (example: railway connection - Japan. Money for expansion of border station to China; fiber optic connection along the route).
2. Regional and international issues
a) Relationship with Russia
N described ratio as actually normal (except for problems with regard to oil / natural gas - see above). He is in close personal contact with Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin. The last meeting in Moscow a fortnight ago.
Yeltsin had promised to fully support the ""two new boys"". From his, N's point of view, this was absolutely necessary, as many obstacles would be put in their way. His overall impression: Chubais and Nemtsov would advance the reforms (e.g. start, to break up the monopolies like Gazprom); if things go on like this, real positive changes can be expected in 2 years; it is a misfortune that Moscow and the regions were pulling on different strands.
b) Development in China
N think there won't be any big changes anytime soon - one has to be prepared for Jiang as president for the next 10 years. When asked about the successor to MP Li Peng, N. said, ""hard to say"", he estimated that it would be the current deputy MP for economics Zhu Rong. In any case, the leadership would be well advised to pick an economic expert.
c) Development in Iran
In response to questions from BK, N explains that he has very good relationships with the leadership and that he will meet Rafsandjani again in 3 days. Fundamentalism was not a problem - Kazakhs were not religious, but a real problem in Uzbekistan. He had worked a lot to bring Iran and the US together, so far without success, even if both sides kept saying that they wanted to. Rafsandjani wanted to open up the country. However, he said the Islamic revolution was only 15 years old. As long as the mullahs were still in power, it was basically impossible to turn the country into a secular country. However, the generation of 30-40 year olds hated the regime, which could not last in the long term. The U.S. blockade policy, however, is not the right approach towards Iran.
The Chancellor agrees with the latter statement. He, too, had repeatedly taken the view that it was not wise to drive a country into isolation (see the discussion on China). N. could say this to Rafsandjani. U.S. policy towards Iran has an irrational background. He had tried very hard to keep a middle line and was attacked a lot for it. He also sought talks with Iran on behalf of the murdered Israeli MP Rabin because of the locked Israeli pilot Ron Arad.
N. throws in that he was also called in because of this - the pilot probably did not exist.
The Chancellor asks how much power did Rafsandjani actually have? He was now leaving office. What did the leadership really want? Lately we had had the Mykonos affair. An independent court had made clear statements about Iran's involvement - the federal government had no influence whatsoever on the judges and the verdict - the courts were completely independent. Iran did not want to understand this and has reacted inappropriately. His interest was to help reduce tensions. He believes that Rafsandjani was basically good willed - something else probably applied to the religious leadership.
N. points out that Rafsandjani would be leaving in May. He did not submit to the religious leadership. He would take on an important function in the Islamic Council - and thus had a de facto influence on all areas of the country. The current President of Parliament, Nuri, had the best chance of being promoted by the religious leadership. No matter who could get hold of it, the country had to open up. But Iran was primarily interested in working with Germany. If the Chancellor wanted, he could use his influence and urge high-ranking people from Iran come to Germany.
The Chancellor agrees with the analysis that there was no other way than opening up in the long run. His interest was not escalation. Now one had to wait for the choice. Then it would be Iran's turn. At the moment, it did not make sense to talk to Iran. First of all, Iran had to make genuinely positive gestures in order to significantly improve the mood.
N. said that a complete turnaround in the political leadership in Iran would not be possible anytime soon. However, the tendency was important, especially since the younger generation was moving away from the stigma of the mullah regime.
In truth, the were already leading a double life today. He agreed with the Chancellor’s basic assessment. In any case, the policy of the Americans was wrong. He had the impression that Iran wanted to establish close associations with Germany as the largest European country. This could trigger a helpful development.
The Chancellor repeated that he was against an embargo policy, but first the climate in Tehran had to change. It was now Iran’s turn. N. only has to consider the previous allegations from the American Congress against the Germans; now the ruling on the terror attack in Berlin has been added, which the Americans accept as evidence of their policies. If he, N., saw Rafsandjani, he could tell him that he, the Federal Chancellor, did not want an escalation, that real gestures on the part of Iran were now necessary.
In response to questions from the Chancellor, N. explained that the President of the Parliament, Nuri, was recently in Almaty on his way to Moscow. He made it very clear to him that Iran's policy must change. He replied that Iran did not want to extend fundamentalism to other countries; if he was elected, he wanted to open up the country's economy.
The Chancellor asks N to keep him informed about his further talks with Iran directly.
d) Situation in Afghanistan
In response to questions from the Chancellor, N. explains the situation in Afghanistan: Although there is no common border (500 km away; immediate border only Tajikistan; while the Chinese border is 300 km away). The situation was being followed very carefully, especially since the route via Afghanistan / Pakistan would be ideal for the export of oil and natural gas (the same applied to the Turkmen and Uzbek sources). Ultimately, he says, he didn’t care who was in power in Afghanistan: The essential thing was to finally gain clarity and calm in Afghanistan. War had been raging there for 20 years. Everyone tried to end the war, but to no avail. The troops on the border between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan had been reinforced to prevent individual groups from spilling over. Pakistan was currently supporting the Taliban. However, it was unknown who was at the top. Dostum and Moussad were other important figures. One tribe fought against the other; each region had its own bosses. Iran (like the U.S. and Saudi Arabia) supported the Taliban.
e) NATO Expansion
N. emphasizes that he appreciated the fact that the Chancellor was including Russia in the European process. Neither Yeltsin nor Chernomyrdin were actually against NATO expansion; they just didn't want to lose face.
The Chancellor explained that he was trying to help. Many in the West were not very smart about this. His position was simple: He was trying to help involve Russia and at the same time support the reform process. He could not make a forecast. But if you did not help, the risk was greater. His goal was a good, sensible relationship.
N. replied that he had advised the Russian leadership to proceed pragmatically. One had to keep in mind that there were of course opponents in Moscow,
the Communists and those who had not given up imperial thinking. They wanted power, which of course would be bad for Russia, Europe and Kazakhstan. One had be very careful that these forces did not gain the upper hand. And one had to ensure that positive support gave them a ""muzzle"". Of course, some of the Russian demands went too far. The Russians could not expect to decide on key NATO issues.

 M e m o r a n d u m
 Subject: Chancellor's Meeting with Russian President Yeltsin on 17 April 1997 in Baden-Baden[1]
 Here: essential topics and results. From a two-and-a-half hour conversation, the following can essentially be stated:
1. Domestic political situation in Russia
President Yeltsin emphasized that he expected economic progress in 1997, industrial production had grown by 12% in the first 3 months - normally the beginning of the year was more sluggish: inflation at 2.3% per month; the budget deficit would be kept at 3%.
In response to questions from the Chancellor, President Yeltsin pointed out that the army's salaries were not yet under control, and that obligations had been met since February - overall financing was still a problem. Even with the pensions, which were now paid monthly, there were still some backlogs that would be repaid by 1 July 1997. Despite some progress, crime remained a cause for concern. Extremely warm-hearted positive appreciation of the new candidacy of the Federal Chancellor (friendship would grow, additional opportunities for cooperation). Positive evaluation of the visit of the Federal President in Russia in September.
2. Regular German-Russian summits with the participation of ministers
President Yeltsin agreed in principle to the convocation German-Russian summits including relevant ministers from both sides. This proposition had been made by Foreign Minister Kinkel and Foreign Minister Primakov on March 29 under the title ""possible modalities of regular German-Russian summit meetings with the participation of ministers of departments"".
President Yeltsin and the Chancellor agreed to publicly announce their intention at the press meeting.
The Chancellor also pointed out that he had heard that Ambassador Terekhov was returning to Moscow in the summer. He urged the President to name a successor he could trust personally.
3. German-Russian economic issues
President Yeltsin once again asked for Russia to be classified more favorably within the framework of Hermes (from currently category 4 to 3 in the future). The Chancellor referred to the existing criteria and agreed to have concerns examined.
The Chancellor asked President Yeltsin to fill the position of the Russian co-chair for the bilateral economic cooperation council at the highest possible level. It would be important that position adequately reflecting the importance of Germany as a trade and cooperation partner, also in comparison to the Russian perception of similar structures in the relationship between the UK and the USA.
President Yeltsin expressed his understanding for the Chancellor's concerns and named various scenarios and a variety of names (Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Prime Minister Nemzow).
The Chancellor thanked the President pointed out that, depending on the person on the Russian side, we might think of filling the position with Finance Minister Waigel and Minister of Economics Rexrodt, for example.
On the sidelines of the meeting, I drew the attention of Russian colleagues to three individual cases (Hochtief, Kirov-Werke Leipzig, Tyumen project)
4. Demand of the Russian Orthodox Church for the return transfer of land that was awarded to the Russian Church in Exile in the Third Reich:
President Yeltsin handed over a letter from Patriarch Alexei and noted that the assignment of the land to the Russian church in exile based on a law from the Nazi era must appear strange.
The Chancellor replied that he was aware of the complex of questions, but that he would have the legal situation checked again and that he would reply to President Yeltsin in a letter to be passed on to the Patriarch.
5. Questions regarding the description of real estate in the former Soviet Union (in Russia) in connection with the move from Bonn to Berlin
President Yeltsin pointed out the difficulties and expenses.
The Chancellor agreed to look into this. He would be informed in detail and would then reply to the President in writing.
6. German-Russian Commission of Historians
The Chancellor reiterated his interest in an early agreement based on the latest German proposals to fill the positions.
President Yeltsin pointed out that most of the precautions had been taken; he would inform the Chancellor about the Russian representatives as soon as possible.
7. Rehabilitation of Germans
President Yeltsin emphasized that at the moment one was actively examining possibilities of additional measures for the rehabilitation of German citizens.
8. Repatriation of Cultural Goods
a) President Yeltsin pointed out at the beginning that he had thought intensively about the letter from the Chancellor. He felt it was necessary to move forward now. As a gesture to initiate the return process, he announced the return of the Rathenau archives and he handed over the first files to the Federal Chancellor.
The Chancellor expressed this thanks and named the Federal Chancellery as the point of contact for further action.
b) President Yeltsin also gave the Chancellor a list in Russian of objects from Russia that had been brought to Germany due to the war and that were in various libraries and museums. The examination of the list and returns are of great importance and would facilitate further progress and understanding in Russia. It would be good if the German side could consider such a gesture for the visit of Federal President Herzog in September.
The Chancellor agreed to a confidential review. With regard to the further procedure, President Yeltsin and the Chancellor agreed to inform the press today that the Federation Council had postponed its vote and that the decision would probably be made in April that President Yeltsin should refer the matter to the Russian Constitutional Court announced that the Federation Council would join the Duma.
The Chancellor and President Yeltsin also agreed that the confidential discussions by their personal representatives - on the Russian side Diplomatic Advisor Jastreschembski, on the German side the signee - should soon be continued in order to “propose practicable and sensible solutions to the President and the Chancellor ""(confirm agreement on this to the press only in general form – prior to lunch informal exchange of opinions, for instance the establishment of foundations for some goods).
9. Return of the microfilmed archives of the Central Committee of the SED
President Yeltsin informed the Chancellor that he had signed a decree on the return the microfilmed archives of the Central Committee of the SED located in Moscow (Deputy Minister of Culture would explain this to the press).
Mr. Jastreschemski added that the President had instructed the Foreign Ministry, in cooperation with ""Ross Archiv"" (phonetically) to prepare the relevant agreement with Germany.
The Chancellor thanked for this gesture, he asked the Russian side to discuss further action in detail with the Federal Chancellery (signee).
10. Expansion of cooperation between German and Russian universities
The Chancellor emphasized that he was considering how best to give a new impetus for the expansion of cooperation and exchange between German and Russian universities. For example, one could envisage the conclusion of a special cooperation agreement between 5 - 10 German and Russian universities. A first step could be the exchange of at least one young lecturer each for a year, other lecturers would then follow on an annual basis; as a second step, 10-20 students could follow the same pattern.
President Yeltsin basically agreed with the ideas and pledged to take a closer look at the ""model"".
11. NATO expansion / NATO Russia
The starting point for the intensive discussion was the question that the Chancellor queried President Yeltsin about his assessment of the meeting with President Clinton in Helsinki.
President Yeltsin emphasized that the conversation was very difficult and the climate was good. After the first round, he saw that it was useless to continue the conversation about withdrawing the decision to expand NATO. He therefore admitted to signing a treaty between NATO and Russia under certain conditions (non-stationing of nuclear weapons and conventional armaments in the new NATO member states; creation of a joint body with decisions in consensus with Russia; adaptation of the CFE treaty). He further stressed that he would be ready to sign "" a fair treaty"" with NATO if NATO accepted the conditions he had set out. He had agreed to this, even though he still considered the NATO expansion to be the Alliance's greatest mistake."" Unfortunately, the ongoing talks between NATO Secretary Solana and Foreign Minister Primakov would reveal that NATO was not ready to fulfill Russia’s conditions. NATO showed no rush to enable Russia to sign the treaty.
The Chancellor replied that he was amazed at these statements. Yesterday, he had called Secretary General Solana. The latter had clearly confirmed to him that he would do everything possible, if at all possible, to enable an agreement to be reached before the planned meeting in Paris on 27 May 1997. Substantial progress had been made in the negotiations so far. Successful completion seemed possible. The desired partnership with Russia on the basis of the document entailed new substantial, new and forward-looking elements. In particular, the consultation mechanism allowed comprehensive cooperation on all questions of European security. His collaborators had told him that there was 90% agreement on Chapters Ibis IV of the document. The questions that were still open in this regard appeared to be solvable; this also applies to questions relating to the name of the document. It was correct that the core problem was Chapter V ""Military Dimension"". Here, too, the Alliance had shown a willingness to make far-reaching concessions:
- Repetition of the declaration on nuclear deployments
- Formulation on the stationing of conventional armed forces / infrastructure
- Reference to CFE adaptation with conclusion of framework agreement by early summer
- Statements on transparency and confidence building
President Yeltsin interrupted the Chancellor and pointed out that so far he had only received information from Foreign Minister Primakov over the phone. After his return, he would call him over and have a detailed conversation with him.
The Chancellor went on to say that President Yeltsin must see that we are at the beginning of a long-term process in which mutual trust should grow. Russia should therefore put the positive development of the NATO / Russia relationship in the foreground.
He urged the President to focus on this long-term and confidence-building perspective. At the same time, Russia had to see that the alliance had shown far-reaching concessions. In no case could the alliance accept that there were second-class members of the alliance. Therefore, it could not meet demands that amount to a binding agreement of the unilateral declarations on nuclear deployments and conventional armed forces.
The Chancellor also asked that he had heard that Russia was allegedly considering introducing new ideas on the issue of CFE adjustment.
President Yeltsin affirmed that upon his return he would speak to Foreign Minister Primakov about these issues. (On the sidelines of the meeting, I took up the CFE question with my colleague Jastreschimski. He looked up the conversation documents and translated both the short and long versions for me. Even if the text was formulated extremely technically, it seemed to be resemble the tendency that the Foreign Office had previously determined in discussions in Vienna).
The Chancellor went on to say that, in his view, it was important that the negotiations bring about a good outcome for President Yeltsin as well. The best way to do this would be to meet the target date in Paris on 27 May 1997. He feared that the closer one got to Madrid the general conditions would deteriorate. The negotiations should of course continue at the Solana / Primakov level. In addition, he offered the President to be helpful if the President deems this necessary in order to get things moving in the right direction. Such contact was possible at any time, either directly or via the two personal co-workers. However, this must be done in complete discretion.
President Yeltsin thanked the Chancellor for the explanations and confirmed that he, too, would do everything possible to prepare the contract by Paris and to sign it there. Finally, the Chancellor and President Yeltsin agreed on a common line for the press conference in the afternoon.
12. Other international questions
a) China
President Yeltsin praised the Chinese President's upcoming visit to Moscow as an important step in the positive development of relations. The envisaged treaty on the reduction of the military presence at the borders was a particularly positive sign (signed together with the 5 presidents of the Asian CIS republics)
b) Iran
When asked by the Chancellor, President Yeltsin stressed that Russia did not support Iran in developing missiles. Russia had concluded supply contracts with Iran for tanks, armored personnel carriers and anti-aircraft missiles of the type S 30 (3000?) which had a purely defensive character. In this context, Russian experts would instruct the Iranian military. Otherwise, cooperation in the nuclear sector only related to the construction of the Busher nuclear power plant. The USA had spoken out against these deals - Clinton had not taken up the complex of questions in Helsinki.
c) Ukraine / Belarus
 Brief exchange of views on developments in both countries.
President Yeltsin emphasized that everyone was waiting for his visit to Kiev which was planned for the end of May / beginning of June, during which he would sign the basic treaty and agreements on the Black Sea Fleet (brief explanation of the envisaged division of the fleet and the status of Sevastopol).
d) Denver Economic Summit
The Chancellor and President Yeltsin thought that the agreed structure (""G 8"") of the summit in Denver was unanimously positive. On the basis of the letter from Undersecretary Stark that was before him, the Chancellor reaffirmed the need to concentrate on a few important topics instead of all topics in the world (e.g. . infectious diseases. President Yeltsin strongly agreed.

 Subject: Chancellor's Telephone Conversation with Polish President Kwasniewski on Thursday, 12 September 1996, 9.30 hours[1]
 After greetings, President Kwasniewski remarked that the ""Weimar Triangle"" was now complete, because he had President Chirac as a guest and the Federal Chancellor on the phone.
The Chancellor asked President Kwasniewski to send a warm greeting to President Chirac.
President Kwasniewski went on to say that the Chancellor had recently held talks in Kiev and Moscow and expressed his interest in hearing about the question of NATO and EU enlargement.
The Chancellor said he would be happy to report on his talks with President Yeltsin. The question of EU membership had not been discussed. This topic was not a priority for Moscow. He had talked intensively with President Yeltsin for 4 hours. Mentally, Yeltsin had been completely present. Of course, he looked forward to his surgery with concern. He would be placed two bypasses each. This kind of surgery was not particularly difficult today. Only the general constitution could be a problem. We could all only wish that President Yeltsin got through the surgery well and could take office again at the end of November. He spoke very openly with President Yeltsin and told him that it was the common will of Germany, France, Great Britain, the USA and others not to put the question of NATO expansion on the back burner. He also stressed that no one had a right of veto on this issue, not even Russia. President Yeltsin did not like to hear this, but that was our opinion. In a nutshell, one should proceed in such a way that nothing should be done during Yeltsin's illness. This also had the advantage of keeping the issue out of the U.S. election campaign. Within NATO one wanted to start now to bring the necessary reforms on the way. At the beginning of the year, one wanted to start negotiations with the states which wanted to join such as Poland, for instance.
At the same time, talks should be held with Russia with the aim of satisfying Russian security needs. The same applied to President Kuchma, who was interested in being involved. In early summer, perhaps in June, a NATO conference could take place at the level of heads of state and government. In 1997 the whole thing had to be completed. President Yeltsin had accepted this schedule. However, the substance still had to be negotiated. This had not been not discussed. From the Chancellor's point of view, this was a satisfactory schedule. He thought it was important that our Polish friends had clarity as soon as possible.
President Kwasniewski thanked the Chancellor.
The Chancellor asked whether these proposals were acceptable to Poland.
President Kwasniewski replied that if the decision was made in June / July 1997, he would fully agree with it. He also thought this schedule was realistic.
The Chancellor reiterated the importance of keeping quiet during Yeltsin's illness.
President Kwasniewski said he understood this very well and knew that it was the way to build trust.
The Chancellor said that Yeltsin would be absent for several weeks. He, Kwasniewski, considers this statement to be optimistic. He hoped, however, that it would be so.
The Chancellor noted that if President Yeltsin were to fail, it would be a disastrous development. One had to restart talks again.
President Kwasniewski went on to say that the Chancellor's optimism had often been confirmed; therefore he had hope this time too. From the Polish point of view, it was important to closely involve Ukraine in this process.
The Chancellor emphatically agreed. Ukraine was essential for the statics of Europe.
President Kwasniewski referred to the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Norway in November and noted that he had heard that Russia was also participating. He asked whether the applicant countries had also been invited. He said he was in favor of Russia taking part in the discussion, but for reasons of balance it was important that the candidate countries should also be invited.
The Chancellor promised to take care of it.
President Kwasniewski added that the invitation only referred to an observer role. He asked whether the encounters of the ""Weimar Triangle"" could not be intensified.
The Chancellor agreed. The staffer should share their thoughts on this.
President Kwasniewski proposed that President Chirac, the Chancellor and he himself would meet in Poland in the first few months of the coming year.
The Chancellor agreed. The staffers should talk about an appointment.
President Kwasniewski asked if the Chancellor would be happy to talk to President Chirac about the outcome of this telephone conversation and whether the date for the trilateral meeting in the first half of 1997 was all right.
The Chancellor agreed.
President Kwasniewski mentioned the soccer match between Poland and Germany in Zabrze 1 week ago, where unfortunately there were unpleasant arguments. Yesterday Borussia Dortmund played against Lodz in Dortmund. A banner had been held up there by the football fans asking for their forgiveness for the events in Zabrze. He thinks this gesture was great. He had never seen anything like it during his time as Minister of Sports. He wanted to thank for this gesture.
The Chancellor expressed satisfaction at this apology. It was a shame for Germany what happened at the game in Lodz.
In conclusion, the Chancellor remarked that they wanted to proceed as discussed. He thinks this was very important.
The conversation ended after 20 minutes.
